symbolmap_emmentaler.xml must be opened in a browser (best: Firefox)
XSLT and JavaScript are used to convert the SVG font to symbols that
can be referenced by <use> elements. Bounding box information is 
added using the JavaScript API (getBBox), that's why a browser is
needed.  The output SVG code will be displayed in the browser window
has to be copied and pasted to lib.svg.
